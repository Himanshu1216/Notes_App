currently we are starting frontend and backend server separately. is there any way to start both at same time?
npm i concurrently

then change the scripts in package.json of root folder

 "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
    "server": "nodemon backend/server.js", // Adjust the path to your server file
    "client": "npm start --prefix frontend" // Adjust the path to your frontend folder
  },

npm run dev to run the both
